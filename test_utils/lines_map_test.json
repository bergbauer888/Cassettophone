1
0:00:01,020000 --> 0:00:01,420000
Hey folks,

2
0:00:01,540000 --> 0:00:01,920000
Golang,

3
0:00:01,960000 --> 0:00:03,460000
it's like the heart of the tech world.

4
0:00:04,180000 --> 0:00:04,720000
It's simple,

5
0:00:04,860000 --> 0:00:05,260000
efficient,

6
0:00:05,260000 --> 0:00:07,600000
and perfect for building scalable apps.

7
0:00:08,020000 --> 0:00:08,660000
That's right, Joe.

8
0:00:09,560000 --> 0:00:11
It's a statically typed language,

9
0:00:11 --> 0:00:12,240000
which means less time debugging.

10
0:00:13,520000 --> 0:00:14,560000
It's all about precision.

11
0:00:14,780000 --> 0:00:15
Wrong,

12
0:00:15,160000 --> 0:00:15,540000
Kamala,

13
0:00:15,820000 --> 0:00:18,400000
Golang is the best because it's fast and concurrent.

14
0:00:19,200000 --> 0:00:20,200000
It's like winning at everything.

15
0:00:20,360000 --> 0:00:20,500000
Well,

16
0:00:20,580000 --> 0:00:20,800000
Donald,

17
0:00:20,940000 --> 0:00:23,360000
it's also great for cloud native development.

18
0:00:24,060000 --> 0:00:26,120000
It's all about that server side magic.

19
0:00:27,340000 --> 0:00:29,340000
And let's not forget its simplicity, Joe.

20
0:00:30,260000 --> 0:00:33,120000
Goratines and channels make multi-threaded code a breeze.

21
0:00:33,220000 --> 0:00:34,280000
Exactly, Kamala.

22
0:00:35,280000 --> 0:00:36,780000
And did you know it's used by Google,

23
0:00:36,920000 --> 0:00:37,020000
Uber,

24
0:00:37,380000 --> 0:00:37,640000
and Dropbox?

25
0:00:39,120000 --> 0:00:39,980000
It's like the best of them.

26
0:00:40 --> 0:00:41,120000
That's the spirit, folks.

27
0:00:41,320000 --> 0:00:43,280000
Golang is all about efficiency and power.
